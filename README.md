# sigma-wallet

## Description
This repo implements the smart contracts for the sigma wallet project developed at ETHGlobalParis hackathob.
The main contracts developed are:
- `ProviderManager.sol`: contract that manages the different providers and its public keys, it allows for the addition of providers (like for example GoogleProvider) as an authentication method.
- `GoogleProvider.sol`: `IProvider.sol` implementation for Google OAuth, allowing the user to log-in with their Google account.
- `SigmaWallet.sol`: Wallet contract, can only be accessed by the entrypoint, validates signatures and executes transactions
- `SigmaWalletFactory.sol`: contract that handles the creation of new wallets in case the user does not have one

These contracts receive interactions from the front/backend and execute them.
